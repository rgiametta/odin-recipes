   <p><center><h2><i><b>A Brief History</b></i></h2></center></p> 
   <p><center>Ratatouille is a dish originating from Provence, France. It is essentially a stew of a different combination of vegetables with tomato sauce usually used as the foundation. There are many different ways of preparing this meal
        but we will outline how to make it so that it is most resembling the meal shown in the Pixar animated series <i>Ratatouille</i>.First appearing in 1877, the dish 
        was originally thought of to be made by those of the "lower-class". It has since been made mainstream, and has grown in popularity since the animated film was released in 2007.</center>
